## Skills

I honed my ability to communicate technical ideas to the public while working as a supervisor at Holland and Barrett. The customer interaction required sensitivity to listen to the customers symptoms and describe a set of products and/or lifstyle changes they could try to improve their condition. Taking any contraindications into account. This developed my problem solving skills and my ability to communicate technical anatomy and physiology to the general public. I have recently been writing articles on medium summarising topics we covered at makers - with the goal of practicing communication of technical ideas. https://medium.com/@benjaminduffield1997
