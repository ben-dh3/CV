<!-- A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what excites you about tech. -->
Self-taught Software Engineer, student at Makers' renowned coding bootcamp. 

I like to help others with my problem solving skills; I support the p5.js community with tutorials and support on forums with the goal of improving my communication of technical ideas, and my Javascript knowledge. Currently I am learning GLSL in the interests of expanding my creative toolbox, so I can build impressive visual projects and digital art.

Over the past 5 years I have been working mainly in retail management honing my teamworking and leadership skills. In previous roles I have quickly been promoted to positions where I'm requires to take responsibility and organise a small team of people.

I am most interested in working in an emerging area of tech such as AI or cryptocurrency.  
I am excited to use my coding skills to help people solve their problems and creating content to help people do that - blogs, videos. 

Using my creativity and knowledge to teach people, and create resources, innovative web apps.

<!-- Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had.  -->


<!-- Here's an example

#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic. -->

<!-- #### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)
