## Skills

**Communication**

I honed my ability to communicate technical ideas to the public while working as a supervisor at Holland and Barrett. The customer interaction required sensitivity to listen to the customers symptoms and describe a set of products and lifstyle changes that will improve their condition, while taking any contraindications into account. This developed my problem solving skills and my ability to communicate technical anatomy and physiology to the general public. I use my skills to write articles for [Code & Jobs](https://www.codenjobs.com/blogs?username=ben) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@benjaminduffield1997) publications. 

**Teamwork and Organisation**

During my time working in a cabinet making warehouse as part of the delivery team, I oversaw a changeover of staff and was responsible for organising a new multi-cultural team of freelancers and employees. I was a bridge of communication between the staff and the manager with whom I worked closely. Successfully contributed to positive team morale while working long days and 90 hour weeks.

**Problem Solving**

**Organisation**

As part of the management team at Waterstones Cafe I was responsible for delegating tasks and organising the team. Motivating team by including them in management decisions, we decided together about product changes and furniture layout to support sales, contributing to an increase in sales YOY.
