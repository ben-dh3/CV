## Skills


**Communication**


I honed my ability to communicate technical ideas to the public while working as a supervisor at Holland and Barrett. The customer interaction required sensitivity to listen to the customers symptoms and describe a set of products and lifestyle changes that will improve their condition, while taking any contraindications into account. This developed my problem solving skills and my ability to communicate technical anatomy and physiology to the general public. I use my skills to write articles for [Code & Jobs](https://www.codenjobs.com/blogs?username=ben) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@benjaminduffield1997) publications. 


**Teamwork**


During my time working in a cabinet making warehouse as part of the delivery team, I oversaw a changeover of staff and was responsible for organising a new multicultural team of freelancers and employees. I was a bridge of communication between the staff and the manager with whom I worked closely. Successfully contributed to positive team morale while working long days and ninety hour weeks. As a software engineer I use my teamwork skills while engaging in Agile methodologies and ceremonies to successfully plan and develop engineering projects to user specifications. I regularly apply pair programming where effective, to solve problems efficiently while supporting my peers.


**Problem Solving**


When working as a personal trainer I was responsible for planning and choreographing exercise classes for mixed age groups of between 10 and 20 people; adapting exercises to suit attendees with varying requirements. I use my problem solving skills as a software engineer daily, building projects and contributing to open source software. During my time at Makers Academy I have thrived when making the user the focus of my solution, building features that impact user experience.


**Organisation**


As part of the management team at Waterstones Cafe I was responsible for delegating tasks and organising the team. Motivating them by including them in management decisions, we decided together about product changes and furniture layout to support sales, contributing to an increase in sales YOY. When working in Agile engineering teams at Makers, I introduced discussions and encouraged commenting in our code to ensure knowledge is being shared throughout the team.
